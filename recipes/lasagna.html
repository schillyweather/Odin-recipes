<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the pasta: Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until they are al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>Prepare the filling: In a large pan, brown the ground beef, sausage, or both over medium heat until fully cooked. Add chopped onions and garlic and cook until softened. Stir in the crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce, tomato paste, wine (if using), salt, pepper, basil, and oregano. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10-15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Make the ricotta mixture: In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper until well combined.</li>
    <li>Assemble the lasagna: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish, spread a layer of the tomato meat sauce on the bottom. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, and then a layer of mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layering process until all of the ingredients have been used, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
    <li>Bake the lasagna: Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place it in the oven. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Serve and enjoy: Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.
